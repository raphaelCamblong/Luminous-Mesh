# Luminous Mesh: Control-Plane Architecture

## System Overview

The Luminous Mesh control-plane instance serves as the central control plane for the entire distributed model network. It combines a Svelte-based frontend with a Go-powered Control Plane to create a robust, efficient management interface.

## Architecture Components

### 2. Control Plane (Go)

#### Core Services
- **Node Registry**: Track and manage all connected nodes in the mesh
- **Model Orchestrator**: Handle model deployment and lifecycle management
- **Task Scheduler**: Distribute inference tasks across available nodes
- **Resource Monitor**: Track system-wide resource utilization
- **API Gateway**: Expose RESTful endpoints for frontend consumption
- **WebSocket Server**: Provide real-time updates to the frontend
- **Authentication Service**: Manage user access and permissions

### 1. Frontend Layer (Svelte)

#### Core Structure
- **SvelteKit Framework**: Provides routing, server-side rendering capabilities, and enhanced developer experience
- **Component Library**: Custom Luminous Mesh components for consistent UI/UX
- **State Management**: Leveraging Svelte stores for global state without additional libraries
